- feat: some commands related to marks: `:marks`, `:delmarks`, `:delmarks!`, `:mark`.
- more commands descriptions in README.

## v0.0.8

- fix: `ctrl+v` in Windows is for pasting, so I disable visual block mode key-binding for editing mode.
- feat: add mark feature like VIM, the short cut is `NUMBER + m` to save current page or block, and `NUMBER + '` to load saved mark, and `mod+'` to load saved mark on right sidebar. The NUMBER can be more than 10, actually thousands if you wish.

## v0.0.4

- fix: change `ctrl+enter` to `mod+shift+enter` to jump internal page or tag.

## v0.0.3

- fix: `mod+j mod+j` would conflict with `ctrl+j` on many devices, so I changed `ctrl+j` shortcut to `mod+alt+j` to join sibling block.
- feat: add `ctrl+[` to also trigger exiting editing mode, but still have `mod+j mod+j`.
- feat: add `a` to enter insert mode, but still have `i` do the same thing.

## v0.0.2

- feat: add `mod+j mod+j` to exit editing mode.
- feat: add `ctrl+enter` to jump into internal page, support `[[]]` and `#tag` style, sometimes better UX than DWIM.
- feat: add `ctrl+j` to join next sibling conditionally.
- fix: `zo` and `zm` shortcut not work on latest Logseq release.

NOTE:

1. The joining shortcut can only join siblings without children blocks and support combo and should not be trigger too fast in editing mode.
2. Jumping internal page support combo to select which page to jump.
