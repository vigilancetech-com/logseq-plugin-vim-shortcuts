## Modes

### Normal mode

A block is focused/highlighted.

### Insert mode

You can edit a block.

### Visual block mode

You can select more blocks up and down and move the selected blocks using `j` and `k`.

### Command mode

In VIM this mode can be triggered by `:`, but here, the shortcut is `mod+shift+;`, also can be memorized as `mod+:`. After trigger, you can find an input area at the bottom, you can input some commands here like in VIM. For now it's about 10+ commands, but I believe that would be more.

NOTE: on Windows, the trigger is `ctrl+alt+;`

#### The bottom input features

- Autosuggestion when you input.
- Press `Tab` if only one command matched, the matched command will be autocompleted right away.
- Press `Up` and `Down` to traverse command history, it's a 1000 limit history, I think it's enough to use.
- Press `Esc` to close command mode and back to the main window. For now Logseq can not get focused automatically sometime. so you need to click the main window to continue.
- Just in case bug stuck, there are `Run` button and `Close` at bottom right to help you trigger behaviors.

#### Supported commands

- `:NUMBER` to scroll to specific line or `:-NUMBER` to scroll to specific line to the end or `:.NUMBER` represents scrolling to NUMBER * 100% of the page.
- `:s/` and `:substitute/`: Replace current block according regex, e.g. `s/foo/bar/gi`, Notice it support Regex modifiers.
- `:%s/`a nd `:%substitute/`: Replace current page blocks according regex, e.g. `%s/foo/bar/gi`.
- `:marks`: Show marks.
- `:delm` and `:delmarks`: Delete specific mark ids, e.g. `:delm 1 2 3`.
- `:delm!` and `:delmarks!`: Delete all marks.
- `:m` and `:mark`: Go to specific mark, e.g. `:m 1`.

  - `:go!` and `:go` support `--ns` and `--namespace` to go or create namespace page. e.g. you run command `:go! subpage --ns` on `test` page, then you will be redirect to `test/subpage` for saving your time to input prefix chars.
- `:re` and `:rename`: Rename current page name, if target page exists, page content will be merged.
- `:undo` and `:redo`: Undo and redo last edit.
- `:lorem` and `:lorem-ipsum`: generate random blocks in same level, with `--unit word|paragraph|sentence` to change random block unit.
  - `--unit` has a short style as `-u`
  - `word`, `paragraph` and `sentence` also have short styles as `w`, `p`, and `s`.

## Mark feature notes

- Logseq have `Favorites` and `Recent` feature, and we also have a `Tabs` plugins, the mark feature kind of like Tabs position, but give the power to yourself to decide which is which, that feels good to me.
- Marked pages and blocks can be persisted automatically and graph separately.
- NUMBER can be more than 10, actually thousands if you wish.
- The `m` shortcut could be conflicted with `Markmap` plugin, so if you met this issue, please upgrade `Markmap` plugin to latest version.
- NUMBER=1 is the default one, so you can just press `m` to save and press `'` to load for mark 1.

## Slash commands this plugin added

Because some VIM shortcuts or commands may also need to be as a slash command, so this plugin provides some.

- `/Insert Emoji`: Insert emoji at current position.
- `/Sort Blocks`: Sort sub level children blocks from a to z.
- `/Reverse Sort Blocks`: Sort sub level children blocks from z to a.
- `/Random Bg Color`: Set block background color
- `/Children Random Bg Color`: Set children blocks background color

## Named Background Colors

The named colors you can use in `:bg` command are from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value)

## Search in page

Like in VIM, if you press `/` you can trigger in-page search, and it support smartcase which means if you search in lower case it will match case insensitive and if you search a keyword including upper case char then it will match case sensitive.

## Other notes

- Logseq keybindings support may be changed in future, so just use it for a while if you need it, and it may be conflicted with Logseq future shortcuts.
- Not exactly same with VIM key-bindings, just mimic.
- If you are on journal home page, some shortcuts will redirect you to specific page, because there is no API can stay journal home page and move block highlight line.
- Some shortcuts are not perfect for now, maybe need more polish and some support from Logseq Team.
- There may be more shortcuts coming soon.
- Stay tuned.
- Copy here not means copy to system clipboard, just in memory of Logseq.
- The `VIM` scroll to top shortcut is `gg`, if you want it, you can change Logseq gg shortcut to another one, and set gg in plugin settings JSON file.
- Some shortcuts support VIM-like combo actions, that means pressing `N+action` to run action `N` times.
- The join shortcuts can only join siblings without children blocks and should not be trigger too fast in editing mode.
- Jumping internal page support combo action to select which page to jump.
- All actions support multiple key bindings in settings JSON file.
- `mod` means `Cmd` on Mac, `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux.
- Recommend version of Logseq is `v0.5.9`+.
